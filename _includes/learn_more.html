        <p align="justify">I commited myself to learning how to
          code while completing my master's degree. I quickly realized that working
          in HR wasn't what I wanted to do with my time on Earth. All my life
          I have been creative. Drawing, writing, music, dancing, acting--I've
          always enjoyed expressing myself. However, my dream of being a rock star
          wasn't going so well. Still, I knew that in order to be happy I needed
          to pursue a line of work that allowed me to be creative and challenged
          me at the same time. </p>

          <p align="justify">  Teaching myself to code has been one of the most
            challenging and fun experiences of my life. Working on a coding project
            gives me the same sort of rush that I get from writing a new song.
            There's still a lot that I need to learn, but that's part of the fun of
            coding. I'll never stop being a student, and I'll never stop pushing
            myself to be better.</p>
            <p align="justify">I record indie pop under the name
              <a href="http://www.bridgeunderwater.com" style="color:#FF0000;" target="_blank">Bridge Underwater</a>. I'm currently
              working on a new album that I hope to have out in 2018.</p>
